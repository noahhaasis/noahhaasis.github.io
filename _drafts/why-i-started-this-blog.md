title:  "Why I started this blog"
---

I don't know yet what I will post on here but at least I have ideas.
I'm planning on writing mostly about computer science, lessons learned from mistakes,
solutions I spent ages googling for and simple but fascinating concepts.<br />
Probably my blog will evolve into something I didn't anticipate, so I try to focus more
on my goals here. I hope that writing will help me structure my ideas, think more clearly
and hopefully discover new ideas. As a programmer and engineer I want to improve my writing
skills and as a German speaker, I especially want to improve my English writing skills.
