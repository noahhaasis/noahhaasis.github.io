title:  "How repetition is misused"
---

Without repetition humankind wouldn't be where it's now and wouldn't know what it knows now.
Natural sciences derive truth by discovering patterns in their observations. Math is all about patterns.
And patterns rely, by definition, on repetition. Without repetition there's no pattern.
But repetition alon won't make good learning.
We have to allow and activly encourage students to abstract patterns. Abstraction underlies ever craft, science and art.
Hence I ask every educator to encourage their students to abstract patterns and therefore utilize repetition more effectivly.
